# Assignment 2 - Module 3
# Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 using a loop.

# steps 1: Initialize sum variable
total = 0

# Steps 2: Use a for to iterate from 1 to 50
for num in range(1, 11):
    total += num  # Add each number to total

#Step 3: Display the final sum
print(f"The sum of number from 1 to 10 is {total}.")
