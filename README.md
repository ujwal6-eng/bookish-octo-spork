# ASSIGNMENT 2:
Module 3: Control Structures in Python
 
Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:
1. 	Takes an integer input from the user.
2. 	Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
3. 	Displays the result accordingly.
   
Expected Output:
The program should return an output like:
Enter a number : 7
7 is an Odd number.

12 is an even number.


Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
 
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2.   Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3.   Displays the final sum.
   
 Expected Output:
The program should return:
The sum of number from 1 to 50 is: 1275.
